# Alarm Clock with GUI

This repository contains a simple alarm clock with a graphical user interface (GUI) implemented using Python's tkinter library. The alarm clock allows users to set a specific time and when that time is reached, it triggers an alarm sound to wake the user up.

## Requirements

Before running the alarm clock, please make sure you have the following requirements installed:

- Python 3.x (Python 3.7.9 or higher recommended)
- tkinter library
- pygame library (version 2.1.2 or compatible)

You can install the required modules and libraries using the following commands:

```bash
pip install tk
pip install pygame==2.1.2
```
